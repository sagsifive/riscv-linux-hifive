SiFive I2C controller Device Tree Bindings
-------------------------------------------------

Required properties:
- compatible		: Should be "sifive,fu540-c000-i2c" for HiFive unleased board.
- reg			: Physical base address and size of I2C registers map
- reg-names		: Should contain the resource reg names.
- clocks		: Must reference the frequency given to the controller
- #address-cells	: Must be '1'
- #size-cells		: Must be '0'
- clock-frequency	: desired I2C bus clock frequency

Optional properties:
- interrupts		: Must contain one entry [Currently not working and has workaround]
- interrupt-parent	: Must be core interrupt controller[Currently not working and hasworkaround]

Example:
	i2c@10030000 {
			compatible = "sifive,i2c0","sifive,fu540-c000-i2c";
			reg = <0x0 0x10030000 0x0 0x1000>;
			reg-names = "control";
			clocks = <&tlclk>;
			clock-frequency = <100000>;

			reg-shift = <2>;
			reg-io-width = <1>;

			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;
	};
