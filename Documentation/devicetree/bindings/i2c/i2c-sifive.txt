SiFive I2C controller Device Tree Bindings
-------------------------------------------------

Required properties:
- compatible		: Should be "sifive,i2c0"
- reg			: Physical base address and size of I2C registers map
- reg-names		: Should contain the resource reg names.
- clocks		: Must reference the frequency given to the controller
- #address-cells	: Must be '1'
- #size-cells		: Must be '0'
- clock-frequency	: desired I2C bus clock frequency

Optional properties:
- interrupts		: Must contain one entry [Currently not working and has workaround]
- interrupt-parent	: Must be core interrupt controller[Currently not working and hasworkaround]

Example:
	i2c@10030000 {
                        compatible = "sifive,i2c0";
                        reg = <0x0 0x10030000 0x0 0x1000>;
                        reg-names = "control";
                        clocks = <&tlclk>;
			clock-frequency = <100000>;

                        reg-shift = <2>;
                        reg-io-width = <1>;

                        #address-cells = <1>;
                        #size-cells = <0>;
	};
